Decision Tree Algorithm Implementation in Python

Overview: 

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Algorithm in Python from scratch. The algorithm is used for classification tasks and is built using NumPy and Pandas for data handling, and Scikit-Learn for evaluation.

Requirements:

To run the Jupyter Notebook successfully, you need the following dependencies installed:

Python (3.x recommended)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

Scikit-Learn (for model evaluation and comparisons)

Installation:

To install all required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install -r requirements.txt
